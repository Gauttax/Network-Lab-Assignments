Aim:
Introduction to Packet Tracer, Peer-to-Peer Communication, Study of Cables and
its Color Codes

 Procedure:
1. Open Packet Tracer:
■ Launch Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.
■ Familiarize yourself with the interface, including the workspace, device
selection, and tools.
2. Create a Simple Network:
■ Drag two computers (PC-PT) onto the workspace.
■ Drag a switch (Switch-PT) onto the workspace.
■ Connect each computer to the switch using straight-through Ethernet
cables.

3. Configure IP Addresses:
■ Click on the first computer, go to the Desktop tab, and select IP
Configuration.
■ Assign an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and a subnet mask (e.g.,
255.255.255.0).
■ Click on the second computer, go to the Desktop tab, and select IP
Configuration.
■ Assign an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.2) and a subnet mask (e.g.,
255.255.255.0).

4. Test Peer-to-Peer Communication:
■ On the first computer, open the Command Prompt from the Desktop tab.
■ Use the ping command to test connectivity to the second computer (e.g.,
ping 192.168.1.2).
■ Observe the response to ensure the computers can communicate.
5. Study Cables and Color Codes:
■ Examine different types of network cables provided (Ethernet, crossover).
■ Note the color codes for each wire in the cables:
■ Straight-through cable (used to connect different devices like a
computer to a switch).
■ Crossover cable (used to connect similar devices like computer to
computer).
